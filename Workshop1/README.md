# Electronic-shop
A simple catalog for buying some electronic devices:

Important requireds:
  - Show a list of electronic devices.
  - Display a list of available devices by category.
  - Add devices to Shopping Cart.
  - Checkout and add customer information for delivery.

  Aditional things I added:
    -You can add or delete a product from the Shopping Cart.
    -When you give all the data, it will create a file where you can find that.


  IMPORTAN INFORMATION:
    -I just didn`t read well the "workshop_1.pdf" so I didn't know i had to create a glogal github repository and add the workshops   there (I was doing all on a single repository called "Electronic-Shop")
